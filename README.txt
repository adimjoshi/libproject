LIBRARY MANAGEMENT IN C

I have made a library management system using the ncurses library to make it more interactive.The programme consissts of an interactive menu which helps the user decide from a range of options such as search a book , delete/add a book, issue/return a book and also see the list of books and the list of members.The menu also gives the user the option to view the books of a particular author. The user can also search on the basis of category ( Fiction, Horror  etc). I have also made a header file (libmanagement.h) which is included in the code.
The program uses extensive reading and writing operation from various text files such as ( libbook.txt, libmem.txt etc).The video shows the menu and all the operations in working.The .jpeg file shows the strucutres and the files I have used to make this program. It has been drawn using xfig.
